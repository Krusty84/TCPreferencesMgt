        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 4, 2025</p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy explains how Teamcenter Preferences Mgt ("the App") handles user data. The App is a client application that integrates with Siemens Teamcenter, a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, via its REST API.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App collects and stores the following data locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Credentials:</strong> Your Teamcenter username and password, used solely to authenticate your access to the Teamcenter system.</li>
            <li><strong>Teamcenter Server Address:</strong> The URL or address of the Teamcenter server you connect to.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>No other personal or non-personal data is collected by the App. We do not collect analytics, usage data, or any other information about you or your device.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>The collected data (username, password, and server address) is used exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authenticate your access to Siemens Teamcenter via its REST API.</li>
            <li>Enable the App's functionality to interact with Teamcenter on your behalf.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All data remains stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any other third parties, except as required to communicate with the Siemens Teamcenter system.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>The App does not share your data with any third parties, except for the Siemens Teamcenter system, which processes your credentials and user content (e.g., project data) in accordance with your valid Teamcenter license and Siemens' <a href="https://www.siemens.com/global/en/general/privacy-notice.html">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>Your credentials and server address are stored securely on your device using standard encryption practices. We do not store or process your data on our servers. Data processed by Teamcenter is managed under Siemens' security and privacy policies.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You can manage your data by modifying or deleting the credentials and server address stored in the App. To exercise additional data rights (e.g., access, deletion), please contact your Teamcenter system administrator or Siemens directly, as they manage the data processed within Teamcenter.</p>

        <h2>Compliance with Laws</h2>
        <p>We comply with applicable privacy laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for users in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for users in California, to the extent that they apply. Since the App does not collect or share personal data beyond what is necessary for Teamcenter authentication, no additional user consent is required.</p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the App's data practices, please contact us at [your-email@example.com].</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
